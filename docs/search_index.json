[["index.html", "Preface Author", " Preface This is an evolving, never-complete note for biological marker (biomarker) analysis in the pharmaceutical setting. The purpose is to document the concept of each type of biomarker and analytical approach. In general, it covers the topics of DNA, RNA, protein, and cell types analyses. It also talks about some statistical issues such as multiplicity, power calculation, detection limit, etc that one may face when analyzing biomarker data. Additionally, I provide R code examples for implementing methods. These codes are basic and are for illustration purposes only. This book is not meant for teaching purposes, albeit scientific references and resources are provided in each chapter. The analytical approaches in this book are based on my personal work experience and are not subject to any kind of convention in any enterprise setting. It is open to constructive suggestions. I do not have a strong urge to recommend any analytical approach in real practice since each problem is unique. However, the fundamental principles are discussed in the context of these notes. It is up to the analytical personnel to decide based on the situations they are facing. Last but not least, Markdown, no MS Word. ‚òÄÔ∏è ‚Äî- awesome tomato Author Became a data scientist Towards the end of my second postdoctoral work, I decided to leave academia. Almost a decade of training in research left me nothing so handy for any industrial professions but an analytical mind and skills for learning. Becoming a data scientist was not a coincidence. I like statistics as well as methodologies and I like to deal with data. I didn‚Äôt know what data science was, but I was told that I have a data scientist profile. So I took my first non-academic job as a data scientist. How did I started programing? I was, am, will be ‚Äòlazy‚Äô. I don‚Äôt like to repeat things, especially something like redoing analysis by just changing a predictor, or producing the same table with n different ways. So, while cranking and juggling among three research projects and ‚Äòdealing with‚Äô my advisors‚Äô ‚Äòwhat ifs‚Ä¶‚Äô, I figured out a way to do less and produce more by compressing these repetitions into functions. I even created functions directly output result tables so that I didn‚Äôt need to spend hours perfecting them on MS word. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone about this because I was afraid that if they knew they would ask me to do more analyses. Also, I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal, until one day my friend/colleague said to me, I wish I could have your programming skills. Man, it sounded so cool, even though I was just writing a few comment lines on the screen ‚Ä¶ üòé Then as computations got heavier, I learned parallel computing, logging, etc. I started to enjoy let the computer/server do the work and I was physically somewhere else. Eventually, I was able to build many things according to my needs. It‚Äôs like building a robot and having control over it. I like the feeling of controlling something, I don‚Äôt even get to control my life most of the time. But I‚Äôm a full commander of the programs. (Well, when it‚Äôs not bugging.) More background You probably will understand me better by reading my blogs. Just in case this is not enough to make a professional decision, Here is my CV website. Yes, a website just for my curriculum vitae! Spoiler alert, it‚Äôs boring.

The array contains more than 18,000 variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions, copy number variants) for genes that have been associated with adverse drug reactions, including DILI, and are involved in the processes of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME genes) and antigen presentation (ie, HLA genes).

A next-generation sequencing approach based on the GenDX NGSgo MX11-3 kit‚Ñ¢ that provides full coverage of Class I and II HLA genes at high resolution, with the exception of DRB4, was used. For Class I HLA genes A, B, and C, exons 1 through 8 were sequenced. For Class II genes DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, and DPB1, exons 1 through 6 were sequenced, with the exception of DRB4, where exons 2 and 3 were sequenced. Exons 2 and 3 code for the peptide binding domain of class I HLA, and exon 3 codes for the peptide domain of class II HLA. 7.3.1 HLA nomenclature and sequencing output 7.3.1.1 HLA allele naming nomenclature The suffix ‚ÄòL‚Äô is used to indicate an allele which has been shown to have ‚ÄòLow‚Äô cell surface expression when compared to normal levels. The ‚ÄòS‚Äô suffix is used to denote an allele specifying a protein which is expressed as a soluble, ‚ÄòSecreted‚Äô molecule but is not present on the cell surface. The ‚ÄòC‚Äô suffix is assigned to alleles that produce proteins that are present in the ‚ÄòCytoplasm‚Äô and not on the cell surface. An ‚ÄòA‚Äô suffix indicates an ‚ÄòAberrant‚Äô expression where there is some doubt as to whether a protein is actually expressed. A ‚ÄòQ‚Äô suffix is used when the expression of an allele is ‚ÄòQuestionable‚Äô, given that the mutation seen in the allele has been shown to affect normal expression levels in other alleles. Alleles that have been shown not to be expressed - ‚ÄòNull‚Äô alleles - have been given the suffix ‚ÄòN‚Äô. 7.3.1.2 Sequencing resolution High resolution A high-resolution typing result is defined as a set of alleles that encode the same protein sequence for the region of the HLA molecule called the antigen binding site and that exclude alleles that are not expressed as cell-surface proteins. The antigen binding site includes domain 1 and domain 2 of the class I Œ± polypeptides, and domain 1 of the class II Œ± and domain 1 of the class II Œ≤ polypeptide chains. Low resolution A DNA-based typing result at the level of the digits composing the first field in the DNA-based nomenclature. Examples include: A01; A02. If the resolution corresponds to a serologic equivalent, this typing result should also be called low resolution. Other levels of resolution If high resolution cannot be obtained or if the laboratory‚Äôs agreement with the entity requesting the testing limits the typing efforts to a subset of alleles, the laboratory may report its results at a level of resolution that falls between high resolution and low resolution. Examples are to consider only those alleles expected to be found in the local population or that are designated as common and well defined.3 A third example is typing that assigns a G group designation (eg, A*02:01:01G). 7.3.2 DRB1 and DRB3/DRB4/DRB5 7.4 Reference "],["multiplicity.html", "8 Multiplicity 8.1 Family wise comparison 8.2 False discovery rate (FDR) 8.3 Local FDR", " 8 Multiplicity Multiple comparison in omic data setting. 8.1 Family wise comparison 8.2 False discovery rate (FDR) 8.3 Local FDR "],["power-and-sample-size.html", "9 Power and sample size 9.1 Sample size calculation in in vitro studies 9.2 Sample size calculation in omics studies 9.3 Sample size calculation for calibration studies", " 9 Power and sample size 9.1 Sample size calculation in in vitro studies 9.2 Sample size calculation in omics studies Consideration of false positive results 9.3 Sample size calculation for calibration studies 9.3.1 1.

A high ICC (close to 1) indicates high similarity between values from the same group. A low ICC (ICC close to zero) means that values from the same group are not similar.

Sample size for calibrations 9.3.2.1 The calibration function The goal is to associate a test value (e.g. RNAseq) to a reference value (e.g. nanostring) via a calibration function. We collect N samples of paired measured: \\(\\{(X_i, Y_i), i = 1... N\\}\\), where \\[ X_i = \\tilde{X_i} + \\epsilon_i^x \\\\ Y_i = \\tilde{Y_i} + \\epsilon_i^y\\\\ \\tilde{Y_i} = f_0(\\tilde{X_i}) +e_i \\] where \\(\\epsilon_i^x ,\\epsilon_i^y, e_i\\) are zero mean errors with variance \\(\\sigma_i^{x2}, \\sigma_i^{y2}, \\sigma_0^2\\) In simple calibration function, we assume a linear function: \\(f_0(x) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1X\\). We want to estimage \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1\\) to solve the calibration function. Some considerations for calibration function: the variance of the measurement error often depends on the underlying level. standard deviation for the measurement error is proportional to the underlying value the CV (SD/mean) of themeasurement error is approximately a constant therefore the estimate of variance, assuming: \\[ \\sigma_i^x = CV_x \\times \\tilde{X} \\\\ \\sigma_i^y = CV_x \\times \\tilde{Y} \\\\ \\] For estimating parameters in calibration function see the reference paper for different senarios. 9.3.2.1.1 Sample size calculation for calibration \\[ N = max_{k=1..K}\\bigg\\{\\frac{(2Z_{1-\\alpha})^2\\times \\sigma^2(x_k)}{\\delta_k^2}\\bigg\\}\\\\ \\sigma^2(x_k) =(1, x_k)\\sum\\bigg(1, x_k\\bigg) \\] \\(\\sum\\) is variance, co-variance matrix for estimated intercept and slope of the calibration function. \\(\\delta_k, k = 1...K\\) precision levels. Parameters to consider before calculation: x0: x value plan to calibrate with estimated calibration equation (e.g. \\(\\beta_0=0, \\beta_1=1\\), and this never happens in reality) d0: 95% CI of calibrated x value x: emperical observation of targeted distribution (e.g. mRNA levels from RNA seq or from nanostring) CVx: coefficient variation of measurement X (e.g. nanostring), assume to be constant CVy: coefficient variation of measurement Y (e.g. RNAseq), assume to be constant 9.3.2.2 Sample size calculation examples CVx= CVy = 0.2 x0 &lt;- c(40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90) d0 &lt;- c(5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 100) calc_samplesize &lt;- function(x0, d0, x =seq(5, 1000, length = 1000), CVx =0.2, CVy=0.2) { CVcalibration::samplesize(x0, d0, x = x, # assuming RNAseq raw count data CVx = CVx, CVy = CVy ) } par(mfrow = c(2, 3)) lapply(d0, function(d) { rst &lt;- sapply(x0, function(x) calc_samplesize(x0 = x, d0 = d)) tab &lt;- do.call(&quot;rbind&quot;, rst) # rownames(tab) &lt;- x0 ymin &lt;- min(tab) ymax &lt;- max(tab) plot(x0, tab[, 1], type = &quot;b&quot;, ylim = c(ymin, ymax), ylab = &quot;N&quot;, main = paste(&quot;d0=&quot;, d) ) lines(x0, tab[, 3], lty = 3, type = &quot;b&quot;, pch = 2) legend(&quot;topright&quot;, c(&quot;1 CV known&quot;, &quot;both CVs known&quot;), bty = &quot;n&quot;, lty = c(1, 3), pch = c(1, 2) ) return(NULL) }) 9.3.3 Choosing samples range There are two important considerations for choosing sampling methods: (i) the selected Xi values should cover the entire region of interest and (ii) the particular sampling scheme should help us to obtain an accurate estimate for the calibration function. There are several obvious choices: randomly sampling from the stored samples (sample more from important regaions, but less accurate) uniformly sampling from the given interval of interest (more accurate, less samples from important regions to investigate linear assumption) ; a hybrid of the aforementioned two sampling methods (balance between above two): dividing the range of interest into intervals using the quantiles of the observed samples uniformly sampling equal number of Xi‚Äôs from each of the subintervals. par(mfrow = c(1, 3)) set.seed(789) x &lt;- rnorm(500, 2) x1 &lt;- runif(500, -1, 5) qt &lt;- quantile(x) x2 &lt;- c(runif(100,qt[1], qt[2]), runif(100, qt[2], qt[3]), runif(100, qt[3], qt[4]), runif(100,qt[4], qt[5])) hist(x, breaks =30, main =&quot;random sampling&quot;) hist(x1, breaks = 30, main =&quot;uniform sampling&quot;) hist(x2, breaks = 30, main = &quot;hybrid sampling&quot;) 9.3.4 Estimating coefficient variation (CV) within the same measures repeated measures in the same sample to obtain the estimation of CV in both techonologies 9.3.4.1 Consideration for prediction precision Calibration can be viewed as a prediction model. Without any error measurement and assuming constant error variance, a linear model can be used: \\[Y_i = a\\beta X_i +b + \\epsilon\\] Uncertainy will be considered when translating the cut-off from RNAseq data to Nanostring. It boils down to estimate with prediction the residual variance. When a sample of size \\(n\\) is drawn from a normal distribution, a \\(1-\\alpha\\) CI of the unknown population variance is given by \\[\\frac{n-1}{\\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2, n-1}}s^2 &lt; \\sigma^2 &lt; \\frac{n-1}{\\chi^2_{\\alpha/2, n-1}}s^2\\] The fold change between the bounds (multiplicative margin of error) can be used as a precision proxy [4]. Formula can be adapted with \\(p\\) parameters [5]. Non linear relationship can be considered with a restricted cubic splines and k knots (k-1 parameters) We assume that k = 3f: dat &lt;- data.frame( MMOE = c(1.1, 1.2), linear = c(235, 71), non_linear = c(238, 74) ) knitr::kable(dat) MMOE linear non_linear 1.1 235 238 1.2 71 74 9.3.5 Final consideration for sample size The sample size consideration should serve the purpose of analysis, which in our case is calibraion and agreement test. These two objectives might render different numbers. In order to gurantee the quality of prelminary analysis, we should take the max{N1, N2, N3}. 9.3.6 Reference [1]T. K. Koo and M. Y.
