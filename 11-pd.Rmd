## Variance covariance in repeated measures

Study deisgn: before and after
Measure the same outcome before and after intervention. Interested in the change before and after the intervention **within the same subject**. We have
$$Var(Y_{i2}- Y_{i1}) = Var(Y_{i1}) + Var(Y_{i2})- Cov(Y_{i1}, Y_{i2}) \\ = \sigma_1^2 +\sigma_2^2- 2\sigma_{12}\\
= \sigma_1^2 +\sigma_2^2- 2 \rho_{12} \sigma_1 \sigma_2$$

Comparing to the measurement **between two independent subjects**, we have $\sigma_{12} =0$, which reduce the the variance $Y_{i2}- Y_{i1}$ to $\sigma_1^2 +\sigma_2^2$

**Assuming** the vriance of **response** is constant across time. We have $\sigma_1^2 =\sigma_2^2 = \sigma^2$, which reduce the within subject variance into $2 \sigma^2(1-\rho)$

This property gives us the ratio of within-subject/ between-subject variance: $\frac{within-subject}{between-subject} = 1- \rho$

## Hierarchical modeling

$$Y_{ij} = \beta_0+ \beta_1 Group + \beta_2 Time + \beta_3 Group \times time + \epsilon_{ij}$$
i - subject;
j - time points

| Group | Time |  coeff|
| ------ | ------ |-----|
|reference|  T0  |  $\beta_0$   |
|treatment|  T0  |  $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ |
|reference|  T1  |  $\beta_0 + \beta_2$|
|treatment|  T1  |  $\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$|

```{r, echo=F}

df <- data.frame(
  time = c("t0", "t1", "t2"),
  time_n = c(1,2,3),
  trt = c(5, 6, 8),
  plc = c(5, 5, 5)
)
df$time <- as.factor(df$time)
plot(df$time_n, df$trt,
  xaxt = 'n', type = "b",
  ylim = c(0, 8),
  xlab = "Time",
  ylab = "Response"
)
axis(side = 1, at = df$time_n, labels = df$time)
points(df$plc, type = "b", pch = 16)
legend("bottomleft", c("Treatment","Standard"),pch = c(1, 16))
